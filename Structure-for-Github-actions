GITHUB actions workflow:
========================================
1. workflow
an automated process that will run one or more jobs
Consist of jobs to executed on the current github repo
Every workflow we give a name to it 
Written in YAML

2. Events
In a workflow we have eents/triggers
What activity in the repo sholud trigger the execution of this workflow 
Example:
 - run the workflow when there is a new commit
 - run the workflow when there is a new push
 - run the workflow when there is a new pull request
 - run the workflow when there is a new merge request
 - run the workflow when there is a new branch created or deleted
 - run the workflow as per the schedule
 - run the workflow from another workflow
 - run the workflow manually 

 3. Jobs:
==========================================
 - what are the tasks to be executed 
 - what commands to be executed
 - in a workflow we can have many jobs 
 - In a workflow jobs run in parallel
 - every job will have a runner and steps to be executed on runner 

 4. Runner - Agent
==========================================
 - Ready-to-use runners managed by Github
 - A VM where we have to run the jobs 
 - A tempoarary Virtual machine provided by github actions 
 - these are azure VM that are readily available 
 - Github actions will run our jobs on these runners/vms/agents
 - Once the job is completed, Github actions will terminate the machine
 - the VM can be of OS
    - linux ubuntu 
    - Windows
    - mac
However Github actions also support self-hosted runners -(your own VMsthat are persistent)
Self-Hosted runners are virtual machines for Github Actions workflows taht you manage and maintain outside of Github

4 Steps:
==========================================
workflow --> JOB --> Runner --> Steps

Jobs will have steps to be run on the runner
every steps will have a name
every step is an action/command to be executed
A step can alson be a script 
A step will have conditions, variables, artifacts
